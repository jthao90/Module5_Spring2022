While condition:
    statements
    loop condtion update

Be sure in your statements you change 'condtion' so you don't make an infinite loop!

Some infinite loops are on purpose...(Making a listener like in an OS or on a server, in a video game)
but generally your code won't want them

Use cases:
    Validate user input: while (input is bad): as for better input
    Counting, searching
